## Project Description/Outline
  Analyze the correlation plane crashes in the world throughout time and the potential causes of them

## Research Question to Answer

1. Do military operators have more crashes opposed to  other types of operators (ie: commercial, recreational)?
2. Do more developed countries with higher air traffic have less crashes proportionally compared to  less developed countries ?
3. Is there a correlation between GDP growth in developing  of a countries and a decrease in plane crashes 
4. Do “outside” factors (ie: terrorism?) have a higher impact than “inside” factors (mechanical failure?)
5. Does the country of origin of the flight crew indicate a high number of fatalities?
6. Are there trends in the time of day that plane crashes occurred? 
7. Do certain decades have higher rates of global plane crashes?
8. How many people on average survive a flight?
9. Visualization of data on maps

## Dataset to Be Used
  Plane Crashes 1908 - 2019: https://www.kaggle.com/chadmunger/plane-crashes-1908-2019
  <br/>Worldwide GDP History 1960-2016: https://www.kaggle.com/jonscheaffer/worldwide-gdp-history-19602016?select=gdp_data.csv

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks
  David 
   -Work with Google API to find out how to look up location information based on names of areas given in current datafarmes
   -Plot everything on maps to help visualize data.
  
  Nahid Farzad
   - Do military operators have more crashes opposed to  other types of operators (ie: commercial, recreational)?
   - Do certain decades have  a higher rate or global plane crashes?
