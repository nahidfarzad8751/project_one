## Project Description/Outline
  Analyze the correlation plane crashes in the world throughout time and the potential causes of them

## Research Question to Answer

1. Do military operators have more crashes opposed to  other types of operators (ie: commercial, recreational)?
2. Do more developed countries with higher air traffic have less crashes proportionally compared to  less developed countries ?
3. Is there a correlation between GDP growth in developing  of a countries and a decrease in plane crashes 
4. Do “outside” factors (ie: terrorism?) have a higher impact than “inside” factors (mechanical failure?)
5. Does the country of origin of the flight crew indicate a high number of fatalities?
6. Are there trends in the time of day that plane crashes occurred? 
7. Do certain decades have higher rates of global plane crashes?
8. How many people on average survive a flight?
9. Visualization of data on maps

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks
  Octavia 
   -Discuss the implications of your findings. This is where you get to have an open-ended discussion about what your findings  "mean". Describe the data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)
  
  Amanda
   -Describe the core message or hypothesis for your project.
   -Describe the questions you and your group found interesting, and what motivated you to answer    them
  
  Sadia
   -Summarize where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions
   -Tell a good story! Storytelling through data analysis is no different than in literature. Find your narrative and use your analysis and visualization skills to highlight conflict and resolution in your data.
